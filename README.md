# FDTD-Demonstrations 
We demonstrate the standard (S) and nonstandard finite difference time domain (FDTD) algorithms using some  simple Python programs

More complete details about these algorithms can be found in our book 

#### This algorithm and other FDTD algorithms are explained in complete detail in 

#### *Computing the Flow of Light, the Nonstandard FDTD Methodology for Photonics Design*,
